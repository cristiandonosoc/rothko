/**
 * STB libraries are created by Sean Barret (https://github.com/nothings).
 * They are single header libraries, in which the implementation is in the same
 * file as the header.
 * To get the declarations, simply include the header. The implementation is
 * obtained by defining the corresponding STB_XXXX_IMPLEMENTATION macro, which
 * will expand the header to include the declarations.
 *
 * This file includes all the implementations of the stb libraries imported by
 * the engine.
 *
 * NOTE: The STB libraries are *highly* configurable by overriding symbols with
 *       macros. Read each library for more documentation.
